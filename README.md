# Coffee Shop Location Optimization

This project uses Python to optimize the placement of coffee shops based on public library locations within Chicago. Using data from the City of Chicago, the goal is to minimize the distance between libraries and coffee shops, ensuring accessibility for book readers to the nearest coffee shop. The project leverages toos such as DOcplex for optimization, geopy for ditance calculation, and folium for mapping.
